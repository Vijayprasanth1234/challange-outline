# FavGiphy-AngularStyle

This project was developed for educational purposes, as a more practical way of getting myself used to Angular 5.

Therefore, this is another retake on the [summer internship challenge I was required to do using React](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/reactGiphyApp), but this time, using Angular.

Live demo available [here](https://edgaracarneiro.github.io/angularGiphyApp/).

For easy access to the code, [click here](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/angularGiphyApp/tree/master/angularGiphyApp/src/app).

Several improvements were also made, namely:
- [x] Routing throughout the entirety of the app.
- [x] Better code structure.
- [x] Signaling of the current tab (Favorites or Feed).
- [x] Fixed Navbar.
